Classification of gender using feed forward neural networks

Dataset: https://github.com/umarani-jayaraman/Gender-Classification-Dataset

Different different optimizers have been used to observe their effect on accuracy

Batch size andlearning rate were also altered to see how they affect accuracy

Precision, recall, F-score, support, specificity, sonfusion matrix, overall accuracy have been calculated for each optimizer
