Classification of domestic and wild cats using feed forward neural networks

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/aniladepu/cat-vs-big-cats-binary-classification

Different different optimizers have been used to observe their effect on accuracy

Batch size and momentum were also altered to see how they affect accuracy

Precision, recall, F-score, support, specificity, confusion matrix, overall accuracy have been calculated for each optimizer
